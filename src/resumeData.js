  aboutme:
    "I am studying on the Enterprise Web and Mobile Development full-time program at Trios College. I have a love for software development and programming and I can see myself excelling in this industry. I am very passionate about becoming Full-Stack Software Developer as my skills include both backend and frontend development and I have deep curiosity in existing and emerging web technologies and enjoy learning new things. My business administration and management degree together with the experience of being banking corporate account manager for more than 10 years, despite being in a different industry, has equipped me with problem-solving and analytical skills that are so beneficial as a developer",
